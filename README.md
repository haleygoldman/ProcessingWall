# ProcessingWall
First stab at making a quick projection wall + touch screen interactive
This project is mostly about learning processing. 
The simple challenge is to make a touch screen interaction that allows a theoretical visitor to write something on a touch screen monitor.  What is written is then saved and moved to the 'wall' where it is projected alongside the prompt.

This branch looks at ways that the basic functioning can include some way to capture what has been drawn.
Two options to be pursued:
    1. Capture an image of what is on the screen save()
    2. Record the movements as XY coordinates in an array - see the example
