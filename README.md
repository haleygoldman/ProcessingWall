# ProcessingWall
First stab at making a quick projection wall + touch screen interactive
This project is mostly about learning processing. 
The simple challenge is to make a touch screen interaction that allows a theoretical visitor to write something on a touch screen monitor.  What is written is then saved and moved to the 'wall' where it is projected alongside the prompt.
